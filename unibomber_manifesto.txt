Also interactive rebase is just a cursed creation- this is to be read after the commit in master; rebase -i is a cursed creation that only madmen and people with too much free time do. I had the briliant idea of following gitflow but merges were done with a squashed commit. I dont even know what i did, i just know it made me suffer.
Also here are my aliases. Great because git log is dogshit by default:

[alias]
lg1 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C>
lg2 = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C>
log-graph = lg1

pase in home/.gitconfig and use log-graph, draws real fancy ascii branch art
way better than having to sift through log output

lg2 is just a bit changed, i forgot why
